### Unemployment in America Mapped Over Time, Nathan Yau
![Map](images/map.png?raw=true "Map")

This piece is interesting to me because it effectively visually represents change over time, specifically the rate of unemployment.  Changes in numbers or statistics are always easier for me to understand when presented in a visual manner, rather than just examining numbers.  In this video, I love the grayscale camouflaged map aesthetic.  It makes the mood of the piece more serious and dramatic, which is appropriate when it comes to unemployment.  I think the use of color would have been too playful and distracting.  I also appreciate that the higher rates are darker colors, because when the darker greys become more prevalent and start to spread, it appears as though a dark cloud is moving over those regions.  This is a great emotional representation of the situation as well.  While watching this video a few times, I noticed myself focusing on a new location each time with special meaning to me.  I felt myself grow almost uncomfortable as the "clouds" began to form over these areas, and happy when they were shaded in a lighter grey. This pieces grows to be especially fascinating around 2008, where average shade of the map darkens drastically.  It is a great tool to help visualize the intense effects that unemployment has had in America.

### Wine and Cheese Map

The interactivity of this map and extensive information provided in a simple manner is what intrigues to me this piece.  Upon first glance, it appeared to me like a large web.  However, as I started clicking through bubbles, I came to understand that each bubble (either a cheese or a wine) had a star of other cheese or wine pairings around it.  I could then click any of the surrounding bubbles and be brought to a new star.  I was very impressed by this method of sharing information.  It seems it would be very effective for someone looking for a broad array of pairings for a certain wine or cheese.  While the aesthetics are not my favorite, I can appreciate that the bubbles are color coded, yellow for cheese and red or white for wine.  Since the main focus of this piece is to convey suggestions and information, the aesthetics may not have been prioritized.  This has inspired me to consider style for my own piece, in which the user is very involved and their clicking controls what they see.
