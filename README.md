Water Graffiti is a travelling art installation that is a wall of LED lights reacting to water contact.  I find this piece particularly fascinating because of both the aesthetic and the interaction with water.  It is magical to watch the LED lights glow when people spray the wall with water.  Humans who interact with this piece have the freedom and capability to draw whatever they would like; it can be something meaningful or they can just play around.  The flow of lighting up is very soft and calming.  Also, I think it is interesting that water is used as the stimulant for this piece.  Water has no shape or color, yet now has the ability to create stunning designs.  It is symbolic to me in that water has the ability to wash away many things in life, and in the same way, it is washing away the darkness in the installation.  I appreciate the monotone color scheme as it adds an element of simplicity and power to the experience.

This piece is a series of 329 black cotton balls attached to spinning DC motors.  As an engineer, I appreciate the integration of a very mechanical system with a large scale art installation.  On their own, each element would be unexciting and quiet.  However, in a large white ceiling filled with them, they are fascinating and noisy.  I think the power in this piece comes from the simplicity of each element combined with the incredible effect that they all have together.  I was mesmerized watching them move together and appreciate the calming atmosphere of the piece.  To me, this piece is metaphorical to the impact that humans can have when we join together.  On our own, we may not be as powerful or as capable of completing a task, but together, we can accomplish incredible things.

### In Order to Control, Nota Bene

In this piece, a series of sentences and words are projected on the floor.  When a human walks through the piece, the segment that their shadow casts through is projected on to the wall.  I enjoyed watching people interact with the piece, catching glimpses of sentences and phrases on the wall.  Although I was never able to read a full sentence, even just picking up adjoined words had a very powerful effect.  The word choices are all very intriguing, and if read in full, would have a very deep meaning worth pondering.  From this piece, I picked up the message that our actions and words directly reflect how others perceive us.  When a person walks through the piece, there are specific words projected that made me think, similar to the way in which people's actions make us think about them as a person.  I think the dark atmosphere and black and white color scheme of this piece makes the message even more serious and less playful, even though the concept is very playful.
